== Dining Philosphers ==

Suppose you have 5 Philosphers sitting at a round table that has food. 
Each Philospher needs 2 chopsticks to eat the food, and there are a total of 5 chop sticks on the table.

Each Philospher picks up a chopstick, then looks for a second chopstick.
Seeing no second chopstick, each philospher puts their chopstick down. 
Repeat ad infinium.

==== SST-ification ====

Each Philospher is an SST component. 

1. The Philosphers as components are connected via links in a ring. The chopsticks are variables (?)
2. The Philosphers are components and the table is a component that has 0 to 5 chopsticks.
3. The Philosphers are components and the chopsticks are components. 

If a metric for livelock is identified, then the specifics of a model (enumerated above) shouldn't matter.

Also, the metric for livelock should not be triggered by deadlock.
